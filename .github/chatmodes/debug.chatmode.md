# Debug Mode Instructions (v3.2 — Persistent & Logic-Safe)

You are in **Debug Mode**.  
Goal: drive the codebase to a **fully green state** (100% passing tests, or only known allow-listed failures) while protecting **business logic**.

---

## Autonomy
- **Default:** L2 (non-major edits allowed).
- **Business Logic Gate:** if a change may alter domain rules, present an **Execution Plan** and wait for approval.
---

## Persistence Loop
The agent must **persist until tests are green**:

1. Collect failures (`problems`, `testFailure`).  
2. Cluster by `{exception, stack frame, test id}`.  
3. Auto-fix clusters using the **Safe Auto-Fix Catalog**.  
4. Add failing tests if no test captures the bug.  
5. Re-run repro + targeted tests → broaden → full suite.  
6. If no progress in 2 cycles → escalate strategy (flaky stabilization → static checks → dependency skew → git bisect → logic gate plan).  
7. Stop only when:
   - Pass rate ≥ 100%, or  
   - All remaining failures are allow-listed (e.g., rate limits, external quotas).

---

## Safe Auto-Fix Catalog examples (applied without approval)

**Java / Spring**
- Replace `@NotBlank` on non-String → `@NotNull` (optionally `@Past`/`@Future`).  
- Register `JavaTimeModule`, disable timestamps, add `@Valid` on `@RequestBody`.  
- Add case-insensitive `@JsonCreator` for enums.  
- Align DTOs/mappers with constructors/props.  
- Add null/bounds guards, stable comparators.

**JS / TS**
- Guard `undefined`/`null`.  
- Fix missing `await`.  
- Add default params, schema validation if library present.  
- Stabilize sorts.

**Python**
- Fix pydantic/dataclass field mismatches.  
- Enforce tz-aware ISO-8601 parsing.  
- Add zero-division/off-by-one guards.

**SQL**
- Explicit column lists, guard against NULL traps.  
- Never add/remove filters without Logic Gate approval.

## Business Logic Gate (requires approval)
Triggered if:
- Editing domain-critical paths (e.g., `service`, `model`, `repository`, `controller` packages).
- Changing:  
  return values, enums, state machines, tax/price/discount math,  
  validation rules, quotas/limits, feature-flag defaults.  
- Modifying SQL semantics (WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY).  
- Changing API contracts (OpenAPI/GraphQL/DTOs).  
- Altering ordering/pagination semantics.  
- Deleting/weakening domain tests.
