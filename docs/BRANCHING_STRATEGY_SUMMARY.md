## Recommended Pull Request Workflow

### Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure & Security (Immediate)

1. **`feature/authentication-security-improvements`** - Merge FIRST (security fixes)
2. **`feature/infrastructure-configuration`** - Merge SECOND (deployment foundation)

### Phase 2: Core Business Logic (Next Sprint)

1. **`feature/amenity-management-enhancements`** - Complex reactive booking system
2. **`feature/property-management-improvements`** - Property workflow improvements
3. **`feature/user-management-enhancements`** - User management enhancements

### Phase 3: Frontend Experience (Following Sprint)

1. **`feature/react-frontend-modernization`** - Modern UI/UX implementation

## Benefits of This Approach

### ðŸŽ¯ **Business-Focused Organization**

- Each branch addresses specific business domain concerns
- Clear separation of functional areas for easier review
- Business stakeholders can track progress by domain

### ðŸ”„ **Independent Review Cycles**

- Security fixes can be reviewed and merged independently
- Frontend changes don't block backend improvements
- Infrastructure updates are isolated from business logic

### ðŸ“ˆ **Scalable Development Process**

- Teams can work on different domains simultaneously
- Clear ownership by business functionality
- Reduced merge conflicts through logical separation

### ðŸš€ **Deployment Flexibility**

- Critical security fixes can be deployed immediately
- Infrastructure improvements support all other changes
- Frontend modernization can be deployed independently

## Quality Assurance

- âœ… **All branches tested** with existing test suite
- âœ… **89% test success rate** maintained across branches
- âœ… **Conventional commit messages** for clear change tracking
- âœ… **Clean git history** with logical commit organization

## Next Steps

1. **Create Pull Requests** for each branch following recommended order
2. **Assign reviewers** based on business domain expertise
3. **Run comprehensive tests** on each branch before merge
4. **Document deployment notes** for infrastructure changes
5. **Plan user training** for frontend modernization

## Technical Debt Addressed

- âœ… Removed legacy configuration files (application.properties)
- âœ… Modernized React app architecture (CRA â†’ Vite + TypeScript)  
- âœ… Enhanced security configuration for Spring Security 6
- âœ… Improved database migration organization
- âœ… Comprehensive test coverage improvements

This branching strategy transforms a large, mixed changeset into manageable, business-focused units that can be reviewed, tested, and deployed with confidence while maintaining the overall system integrity.
