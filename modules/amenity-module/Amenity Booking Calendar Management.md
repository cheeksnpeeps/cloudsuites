Amenity Booking Calendar Management
===============================

The **Amenity Booking Calendar** serves as a tool for tenants and staff members to view the booked and available time
slots for a specific amenity. This calendar provides transparency regarding amenity availability, allowing users to
schedule their bookings efficiently while ensuring that no overlapping reservations occur.

The booking calendar is structured around two key components:

- **Booked Slots:** These represent the time slots that are already reserved by tenants.
- **Available Slots:** These represent the free time slots during which the amenity is available for booking.

The system offers different levels of access to the booking calendar, ensuring that both tenants and staff can retrieve
relevant booking information within a specific time range.

The **Amenity Booking Calendar** offers a clear, user-friendly system for both tenants and building staff to manage
amenity bookings effectively. The focus of the calendar is to streamline scheduling, avoid conflicts, and optimize the
use of amenities, benefiting both users and property managers.

### Key Functionalities

#### 1. **Booking Transparency and Convenience for Tenants**

- **Functionality:** Tenants can access a calendar view that shows both booked and available slots for a specific
  amenity (e.g., a gym, pool, or conference room). This feature allows tenants to easily find and book available times,
  removing the need for back-and-forth communication with property managers.
- **Business Benefit:** This self-service feature increases tenant satisfaction by making it easy to schedule bookings
  on their own time, without needing to wait for confirmation or coordination. It also reduces administrative work for
  staff, as tenants can independently check availability.

#### 2. **Efficient Resource Management for Staff**

- **Functionality:** Staff members, who manage the properties, have access to a full view of the amenity bookings across
  all tenants. They can track how often certain amenities are being used, monitor demand trends, and identify any
  potential conflicts (e.g., double-bookings or overuse).
- **Business Benefit:** This function provides staff with the tools to ensure the fair and efficient use of amenities.
  It helps in identifying high-demand times for amenities, enabling staff to implement policies or pricing structures (
  e.g., peak hour pricing) to manage demand better.

#### 3. **Avoiding Booking Conflicts**

- **Functionality:** By checking both booked and available slots in real time, users (tenants and staff) avoid the risk
  of booking conflicts. The system ensures that no tenant can book an amenity during an already reserved time.
- **Business Benefit:** Avoiding conflicts helps maintain smooth operations and prevents tenant frustration. Clear
  scheduling reduces potential disputes between tenants over amenity access, fostering a more harmonious community.

#### 4. **Support for Advanced Booking**

- **Functionality:** Tenants and staff can view availability for future dates, allowing for long-term planning. This is
  particularly useful for amenities that tend to be in high demand, such as event spaces or pools.
- **Business Benefit:** Advanced bookings help tenants plan their activities and provide staff with insights into future
  amenity use, allowing them to prepare or adjust resources as needed (e.g., cleaning staff for after events). This also
  opens opportunities for property managers to offer premium services like priority or reserved bookings for VIP
  tenants.

#### 5. **Custom Time Range View**

- **Functionality:** The calendar offers flexibility by allowing users to set custom time ranges (e.g., by week, month,
  or specific dates) to see bookings. This functionality is essential for planning around personal schedules or special
  events.
- **Business Benefit:** Offering a customizable view ensures that both tenants and staff can get a clear understanding
  of amenity usage without being overwhelmed by unnecessary details. This flexibility enhances user experience and helps
  staff plan resources around specific busy periods.

### Business Impact

- **Increased Tenant Satisfaction:** Tenants value convenience and autonomy. The booking calendar allows them to
  schedule amenities quickly and confidently, reducing frustration and improving overall experience in the property.

- **Reduced Administrative Overhead:** The self-service nature of the booking calendar frees staff from manual
  coordination of amenity schedules. With fewer inquiries, administrative teams can focus on higher-level tasks.

- **Optimized Amenity Use:** By providing insights into peak usage periods and available slots, the booking calendar
  allows property managers to optimize the use of shared amenities. They can adjust staffing or maintenance schedules
  based on actual demand, improving resource allocation.

- **Improved Conflict Management:** The system eliminates the risk of double-bookings, ensuring a smoother experience
  for tenants and reducing the number of complaints related to shared amenity use.

In summary, the **Amenity Booking Calendar** is a critical tool that drives both operational efficiency and tenant
satisfaction. By making the booking process transparent and easy to navigate, it enhances the value of the property for
tenants, while also enabling better management and resource planning for building staff.
