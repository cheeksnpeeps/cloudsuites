## **Partition Management Migration**

The Property Management System processes a significant number of bookings daily, making efficient data management
crucial. To optimize the system's performance and streamline maintenance, we partition the `Amenity Bookings` table
based on time intervals. Partitioning breaks the data into smaller, more manageable segments that enhance query
performance and simplify long-term data maintenance.

For a step-by-step guide on implementing and managing partitioning for the `Amenity Bookings` table, including
instructions on changing partition intervals, managing old partitions, and more advanced partitioning techniques, please
refer to the [Partition Management Migration Guide](https://github.com/cheeksnpeeps/cloudsuites/blob/main/modules/common-module/src/main/resources/db/migration/Partition%20Management%20Migration.md).

### **Key Features**

1. **Time-Based Partitioning for Amenity Bookings**  
   Efficiently handle large volumes of booking data by partitioning the `Amenity Bookings` table based on time
   intervals, such as quarters or months. This ensures that the database can process smaller chunks of data,
   significantly improving query performance.

3. **Automated Partition Creation**  
   New partitions are automatically created as time progresses, ensuring seamless scalability without manual
   intervention. This keeps the system adaptable as data grows over time.

4. **Historical Data Archiving**  
   Older data, such as bookings that are no longer actively needed, can be archived or dropped. This ensures that only
   active data is kept in high-performance storage, reducing overall storage costs and query overhead.

5. **Partition Dropping and Maintenance**  
   Old partitions that exceed the retention period can be automatically dropped or moved to archive storage, ensuring
   the database remains lean and performs optimally over time.

6. **Retention Policies for Active Data**  
   Retain only the data required for ongoing operations while safely archiving older records. This ensures that
   operational data remains fast to access and reduces the strain on storage.

# Getting Started

Cloudsuites is a web application built with Java, Spring Boot, JavaScript, and React. It uses Maven and npm for
dependency management.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main parts: the server-side code written in Java and the client-side code written in
JavaScript (React).

### Server-Side

The server-side code is located in the `src/main/java` directory. It's a Spring Boot application that serves the static
files of the React application and provides API endpoints that the React application can interact with.

### Client-Side

The client-side code is located in the `src/main/resources/static/app` directory. It's a React application that is built
with npm and served by the Spring Boot application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you need to install the dependencies and start the server.

### Server-Side

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `mvn clean install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `mvn spring-boot:run` to start the server.

### Client-Side

1. Navigate to the `src/main/resources/static/app` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the React application.

Please note that the React application is built and served by the Spring Boot application, so you don't need to start it
separately in production.
